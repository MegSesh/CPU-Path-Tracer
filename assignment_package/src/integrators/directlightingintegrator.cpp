/*
 * You will write another Integrator class's Li function, this time so that it performs light source importance sampling
 * and evaluates the light energy that a given point receives directly from light sources.
 * That means that this Integrator will never recursively call Li.

 * Much of the code in this Integrator is the same as the code you wrote for NaiveIntegrator,
 * but rather than calling a BSDF's Sample_f to generate a Ï‰i,
 * you will randomly select a light source from scene.lights and call its Sample_Li function.

 * Once you have done this, you can evaluate the remaining components of the Light Transport Equation (you already have Li).
 * Sample_Li invokes a few additional functions that you will have to implement; we will detail them below.

 * One final note: you must divide the PDF you obtain from Sample_Li by the number of light sources
 * in your scene to account for the fact that you are choosing a light at random uniformly from the set of all lights in the scene.
 * Mathematically, this just boosts the energy obtained from any one light by a factor of N, where N is the number of lights in the scene.
