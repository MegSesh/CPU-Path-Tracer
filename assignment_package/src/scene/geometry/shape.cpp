/*
 * The Shape class actually declares two different Sample functions,
 * but the one you must implement in the base Shape class is the one
 * that takes in three inputs rather than two.

 * This function must invoke the two-input Sample, to be implemented by subclasses,
 * and generate a Ï‰i from the resulting Intersection.

 * From there, it must convert the PDF obtained from the other
 * Sample function from a PDF with respect to surface area to a
 * PDF with respect to solid angle at the reference point of intersection.

 * As always, be careful of dividing by zero! Should this occur, you should set your PDF to zero.
